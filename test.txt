PRB-4  CH.PRB- 2.1.

True or False: For a ﬁxed number of observations in a data set, introducing more vari-
ables normally generates a model that has a better ﬁt to the data. What may be the drawback
of such a model ﬁtting strategy?


SOL-4  CH.SOL- 2.1.

True. However, when an excessive and unnecessary number of variables is used in a lo-
gistic regression model, peculiarities (e.g., speciﬁc attributes) of the underlying data set dis-
proportionately affect the coefﬁcients in the model, a phenomena commonly referred to as
“overﬁtting”. Therefore, it is important that a logistic regression model does not start training
with more variables than is justiﬁed for the given number of observations.

True or False: In machine learning terminology, unsupervised learning refers to the
mapping of input covariates to a target response variable that is attempted at being predicted
when the labels are known.

PRB-8  CH.PRB- 2.5.

Complete the following sentence: In the case of logistic regression, the response vari-

able is the log of the odds of being classiﬁed in [...].
SOL-7  CH.SOL- 2.4.

False. This is exactly the deﬁnition of supervised learning; when labels are known then
(cid:4)

supervision guides the learning process.

LOGISTIC REGRESSION

SOL-8  CH.SOL- 2.5.

In the case of logistic regression, the response variable is the log of the odds of being clas-
siﬁed in a group of binary or multi-class responses. This deﬁnition essentially demonstrates
that odds can take the form of a vector.
